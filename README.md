# 6502 Processor Emulator
This project is a 6502 processor emulator written in C++. The purpose of this project is to deepen understanding of how processors work by simulating the behavior of the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. The emulator includes various components such as CPU and Memory classes to represent the core functionalities of the processor.

### TODO
- [x] Implement all 6502 processor instructions
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Create argument handling for the program
- [ ] Add debugging functionalities
- [ ] Improve memory emulation
